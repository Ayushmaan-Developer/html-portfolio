<h1> The Best Movie of All Time</h1>
 <h2>My top three pick</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
 <p>this is not a movie but a book of philosophy by Chris Nolan. This movie depicts that sometimes doing right
 thing wil lead you to face dire consequences where sometimes you have to take the fall for greater good.
 </p>

 <h3>Whiplash</h3>
 <p>This is a inspirational movie about the sacrifices and strugle you have to face to become the greatest
 in your field. Great movie for someone who want to follow passion and excell at them.
